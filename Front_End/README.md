# Privacy Guardian Frontend

This is the frontend for the Privacy Guardian chrome extension. 

---

To test out the extension, go to chrome://extensions, click on the "Load Unpacked" button, and update the entire Front_End folder. The Privacy Guardian popup should now appear as one of your Chrome extensions. To debug using the console, click on the "background page" link of the Privacy Guardian section on the Chrome extensions page. Most of the time the Chrome extension should automatically update as you save your work. However, if you notice that updates are not occurring, you should remove the extension and then reload the folder using the above procedure.
