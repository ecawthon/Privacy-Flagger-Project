# Privacy Guardian Frontend

This is the frontend for the Privacy Guardian chrome extension. 

---

To debug using the console, click on the "background page" link of the Privacy Guardian section on chrome://extensions. Most of the time the Chrome extension should automatically update as you save your work. However, if you notice that updates are not occurring, you should remove the extension and then reupload the front end folder.
